Step 3: Create & Upload Your Projects
For each project on your resume, you need a dedicated repository.

On GitHub, click "New repository".

Give it a clear name (e.g., ai-chatbot, text-summarizer-app).

Add a short description.

Do not initialize it with a README (you'll add one manually).

Follow the instructions on GitHub to push your existing local project code to this new repository.

Step 4: Write a High-Quality README for Each Project
This is the most critical step. A project without a good README is like a book with no cover. For each project repository, create a README.md file at the root.

Project README Template (Example for Hayzen AI)
# Hayzen AI â€” Full-Stack AI Chatbot

Hayzen AI is a full-stack chatbot application featuring a secure, multi-factor user authentication system and integration with large language models for dynamic conversation.
